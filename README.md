### Small portable ESP32-based motion detector - Sends a telegram push notification if your pet or a burglar is at the back door and wants in.

The goal was to create a small portable motion detector that runs on battery power only and does not require an external power source. When motion is detected, a push notification is to be sent to the smartphone via WLAN. For the push notification Telegram is used, which means no additional APP is needed, except Telegram of course. The challenge was to consume little power in order to extend the operating time of the motion detector in battery mode. Below you can see a prototype without sun shield and LED.
